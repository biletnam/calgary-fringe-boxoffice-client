README for Calgary Fringe Festival Box Office Client Program


Some documentation needs to go here :-)

This README is accurate (but not complete!) as of Nov. 04, 2012 and client v.0.7.40

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


To compile the program:
    * in Unix, use GNU make (or equivalent) - see Makefile
    * in Windows, use make.bat
   
To run the program:
    * java -jar BoxOffice.jar
    * I also use Launch4Java (see http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/) to make .exe files for
       Windows. There are appropriate config files for L4J in the installer/ directory.

To deploy the program:
    * I use izpack (see http://izpack.org/) to make deployment packages. Again, there are
       appropriate config files for izpack in the installer/ directory. I also then use L4J
       to wrap up the installer in a .exe for windows.
    * See also the public download page at http://boxoffice.calgaryfringe.ca/download/
    * if you prefer a DIY approach, you will basically need to run it from a directory
      containing:
        - BoxOffice.jar
        - calgaryfringe.ico
        - txns_all.dat    # this will be recreated, but best to have a 0-length dummy file
        - txns_done.dat   # this will be recreated, but best to have a 0-length dummy file
        - images/boxofficeform.png
        - images/fringe_logo_64x64.png
        - images/offline_icon.png
        - images/online_icon.png

To hack around in the program:
   * You're on your own for now!
   * BoxOfficeApp.java is the starting point (as per BoxOffice.manifest). From there, you'll
      be mostly interested in BoxOffice.java, and then on to Performance.java and
      WindowData.java...

To get help:
   * email me :-)
